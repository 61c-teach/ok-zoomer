# Ok Zoomer

Various scripts for automating Zoom tasks to make teaching 1000+ students less painful. Inspired [by CS162](https://github.com/Berkeley-CS162/zoom-automation).

## But Why

- This is the same as having some TAs clicking buttons for 64 hours, but with less RSI.
- Using the Zoom API requires the application to be approved by Zoom and/or UC Berkeley.
- The official Zoom API [limits you to 100 meeting API requests per day](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/rate-limits#daily-meeting-createupdate-requests).

## But Why Not

- Zoom has no obligation to not-change its frontend and break these scripts.
